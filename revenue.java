        Revenue can be calculated as the selling price of the product times the quantity sold,
         i.e. revenue = price Ã— quantity. Write a program that asks the user to enter product price and quantity and then calculate the revenue.
          If the revenue is more than 5000 a discount is 10% offered. Program should display the discount and net revenue.
